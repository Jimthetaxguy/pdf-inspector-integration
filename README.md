Rust workspace plus MCP server wrapping the [firecrawl/pdf-inspector](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector)
library for offline, fast PDF classification and extraction, with tax-form,
IRC, SEC-filing, and Sweet tax-review demo helpers exposed as separate tools.

## Status

**Alpha.** The 13 MCP tools compile and load; validation against real PDFs is
partial. Use ground-truth fixtures of your own to confirm fitness for any
specific workflow.

The broader Firecrawl AnyDoc integration is planned but is not yet shipped.
See the [dependency-ordered integration plan](docs/anydoc-integration-plan.md)
for the verified upstream constraints, architecture, and acceptance gates.

Validation snapshot (see [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) for the current
public handoff):

| Tool | Real-PDF validated? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `classify_pdf` | Public-fixture test | Tracked 4-page U.S. Code PDF |
| `pdf_to_markdown` | Public-fixture test | Asserts expected Title 26 content |
| `analyze_layout` | Compile-tested only | No live MCP smoke yet |
| `extract_text_regions` | Compile-tested only | API verified, no live MCP smoke |
| `extract_table_regions` | Compile-tested only | API verified, no live MCP smoke |
| `batch_classify` | Compile-tested only | Loops `classify_pdf` |
| `identify_tax_form` | Unit-tested | No redistributable positive tax-form fixture yet |
| `parse_irc_sections` | Partial | Unit coverage exists; richer public corpus remains required |
| `split_sec_filing` | Unit-tested | No redistributable live-filing fixture yet |
| `list_tax_packages` | Synthetic demo | Lists bundled Sweet demo packages across six tax workflows |
| `review_tax_package` | Synthetic demo | Runs deterministic checks against bundled structured examples |
| `compare_line_items` | Synthetic demo | Compares one return value to one source value with tolerance |
| `render_review_memo` | Synthetic demo | Renders a Markdown memo from structured review findings |

## Why

Coding agents that touch PDFs almost always reach for OCR first, even when
the source is born-digital. That round-trip costs seconds-to-minutes per
document and discards the structural information already present in the
PDF (text positions, headings, table boundaries).

`pdf-inspector` reads the PDF directly: it classifies (TextBased / Scanned /
Mixed) in single-digit milliseconds and extracts to clean Markdown without
calling out to any OCR engine. This project exposes that capability over the
Model Context Protocol so any MCP-aware agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Gemini, OpenCode) can call it identically.

On top of the generic primitives, three domain-specific tools encode patterns
we use ourselves: tax-form identification (W-2, 1099, K-1, 1040), IRC section
parsing for Title 26 PDFs, and SEC 10-K / 10-Q section splitting. These are
layered as separate MCP tools rather than baked into the core extractor so
the upstream surface stays clean.

## The 13 tools

## Install

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jimthetaxguy/anydoc-enhanced
cd anydoc-enhanced
cargo install --locked --path crates/pdf-inspector-mcp
```

This places `pdf-inspector-mcp` in your Cargo bin directory (typically
`~/.cargo/bin/`). To pin a known location, use:

```bash
cargo install --locked --root /usr/local --path crates/pdf-inspector-mcp
```

### Wire into an MCP client

For Claude Code, use its CLI so machine-specific paths remain in user-scoped
configuration rather than this repository:

```bash
claude mcp add pdf-inspector --scope user -- "$(command -v pdf-inspector-mcp)"
claude mcp get pdf-inspector
```

See Anthropic's current [MCP setup documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp).
Other MCP clients can register the absolute path returned by
`command -v pdf-inspector-mcp` as a local stdio server.

## Quick start

The server speaks JSON-RPC over stdio. A minimal `tools/call` for
`classify_pdf`:

```bash
printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"t","version":"1"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"classify_pdf","arguments":{"path":"/path/to/file.pdf"}}}' \
  | pdf-inspector-mcp
```

The same pattern works for any of the 13 tools. Two more one-liners (drop in
the `printf` block above, replacing the third line):

```text
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"identify_tax_form","arguments":{"path":"/path/to/W2.pdf"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"split_sec_filing","arguments":{"path":"/path/to/10-K.pdf"}}}
```

Sweet demo package tools do not require real PDFs; they use bundled synthetic
structured data to demonstrate a provider-neutral review layer:

```text
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_tax_packages","arguments":{}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"review_tax_package","arguments":{"package_id":"demo_1040_w2_schedule_c"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"compare_line_items","arguments":{"label":"W-2 wages","return_reference":"Form 1040 line 1a","source_reference":"W-2 Box 1","return_amount":84732,"source_amount":87432,"tolerance":0}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"render_review_memo","arguments":{"package_id":"demo_1099_bundle"}}}
```

The actual response payload is JSON-encoded inside the standard MCP
`{"content":[{"type":"text","text":...}]}` envelope.

## Architecture

A caller (any MCP-aware agent) speaks JSON-RPC over stdio to the
`pdf-inspector-mcp` binary. The binary dispatches to a thin facade crate
(`pdf-inspector-skillkit`) which wraps the upstream `pdf-inspector` library.
Domain modules (tax / sec / irc) are siblings of the core extractor — each
composes the primitives with format-specific knowledge but never modifies
the upstream surface.

```
  caller (Claude Code, Codex, ...)
        |
        | JSON-RPC over stdio (MCP)
        v
  pdf-inspector-mcp        (rmcp 2.2 server)
        |
        v
  pdf-inspector-skillkit   (facade lib)
   |       |
   |       +-- domain::tax      (identify_tax_form)
   |       +-- domain::sec      (split_sec_filing)
   |       +-- domain::irc      (parse_irc_sections)
   |       +-- domain::sweet    (demo review packages + comparisons)
   v
  pdf-inspector             (upstream, SHA-pinned)
```

## Development

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `cargo build --workspace --locked` |
| Test | `cargo test --workspace --locked` |
| Lint | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` |
| Check candidate text for obvious identifiers | `bash scripts/check-public-hygiene.sh` |
| Validate domain tool against a PDF | `cargo run --example validate_domain -- <tax\|irc\|sec> <pdf-path>` |
| Run Sweet review demo | `cargo run -p pdf-inspector-skillkit --example sweet_review_demo -- demo_1040_w2_schedule_c` |

Server logs and handled errors do not include caller-supplied paths or labels.
Set `PDF_INSPECTOR_MCP_LOG` to one of `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`,
or `trace` to change this crate's verbosity. Raw `RUST_LOG` directives are
ignored so dependencies cannot log protocol payloads.
`batch_classify` retains each supplied `path` in its response to preserve the
existing correlation schema; use opaque staging filenames when response paths
are sensitive.
